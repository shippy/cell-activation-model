This is a pet model of cell propagation using Mesa, an agent-based modeling framework. On localhost, you can run it with `python run.py`.

Unfortunately, the visualization doesn't currently show up on Heroku. This is because Mesa assumes local deployment. [Until my pull request is merged upstream, you can follow the steps outlined in it to view the visualization anyway.](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/pull/421)
